# GIS-Based Traffic Simulation using Mesa-Geo

This project simulates traffic flow on a road network using the Mesa-Geo library. The simulation involves creating vehicle agents that move randomly within a defined geographical space.

## Introduction
This project uses Mesa-Geo, a GIS extension for the Mesa Agent-Based Modeling framework, to simulate vehicle movements on a road network. It provides a visual representation of vehicle positions over time and allows for easy modification of parameters such as the number of vehicles and their speeds.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to model and visualize traffic flow on a road network to better understand vehicle movements and traffic dynamics. This can be used for:
- Studying traffic patterns and identifying potential bottlenecks.
- Simulating the impact of different traffic management strategies.
- Enhancing urban planning and road network design.
- Providing a foundation for more advanced traffic simulations that incorporate additional factors such as traffic lights, pedestrian crossings, and real-time traffic data.

## Features
- Simulation of vehicle movements on a road network.
- Random movement behavior for vehicle agents.
- Visualization of vehicle positions using Matplotlib.
- Easy to modify and extend for different road networks and behaviors.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gis-traffic-simulation.git
   cd gis-traffic-simulation
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install mesa mesa-geo geopandas shapely matplotlib
   ```

3. Download the road network data file (e.g., a shapefile) and place it in the project directory.

## Usage
1. Import the necessary libraries and define the model, agents, and GeoSpace:
   ```python
   import mesa
   import mesa_geo as mg
   import geopandas as gpd
   from shapely.geometry import Point
   import random

   class TrafficGeoSpace(mg.GeoSpace):
       def __init__(self):
           super().__init__()

   class VehicleAgent(mg.GeoAgent):
       def __init__(self, unique_id, model, geometry, crs):
           super().__init__(unique_id, model, geometry, crs)
           self.speed = random.uniform(10, 20)

       def step(self):
           new_position = self.random_move()
           self.geometry = new_position

       def random_move(self):
           x, y = self.geometry.xy
           x_new = x[0] + random.uniform(-0.001, 0.001)
           y_new = y[0] + random.uniform(-0.001, 0.001)
           return Point(x_new, y_new)

   class TrafficModel(mesa.Model):
       def __init__(self, road_network_file):
           self.schedule = mesa.time.RandomActivation(self)
           self.space = TrafficGeoSpace()
           self.load_roads(road_network_file)
           self.create_vehicles(50)

       def load_roads(self, road_network_file):
           roads = gpd.read_file(road_network_file)
           for idx, road in roads.iterrows():
               road_agent = mg.GeoAgent(idx, self, road.geometry, roads.crs)
               self.space.add_agents(road_agent)

       def create_vehicles(self, num_vehicles):
           for i in range(num_vehicles):
               x, y = random.uniform(-10, 10), random.uniform(-10, 10)
               vehicle = VehicleAgent(i, self, Point(x, y), "EPSG:4326")
               self.space.add_agents(vehicle)
               self.schedule.add(vehicle)

       def step(self):
           self.schedule.step()
   ```

2. Run the model and collect vehicle positions:
   ```python
   road_network_file = "path/to/your/road_network.shp"
   model = TrafficModel(road_network_file)
   vehicle_positions = []

   for i in range(100):
       model.step()
       step_positions = [(v.unique_id, v.geometry.x, v.geometry.y) for v in model.schedule.agents if isinstance(v, VehicleAgent)]
       vehicle_positions.append(step_positions)
   ```

3. Visualize the vehicle positions:
   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import matplotlib.animation as animation

   fig, ax = plt.subplots()
   scat = ax.scatter([], [])

   def init():
       scat.set_offsets([])
       return scat,

   def update(frame):
       positions = vehicle_positions[frame]
       data = [(x, y) for _, x, y in positions]
       scat.set_offsets(data)
       return scat,

   ani = animation.FuncAnimation(fig, update, frames=len(vehicle_positions), init_func=init, blit=True)
   plt.show()
   ```

## Visualization
The simulation can be visualized using Matplotlib. The positions of the vehicles are updated in real-time, providing an animated view of the traffic flow.
